#summary What Pau is been working on in libmv.


= Currently working on =
 * The reconstruction data structure.
 * Simple guis for testing current code.


= To do =

 * Reconstruction structure
   * Define the FeatureSet, Structure, Reconstruction, ...
   * Fix Kd-tree implementation:
     * Avoid moving the original points
     * Add min/max bounds to nodes to correctly approximate the L2 distance when prunning
 * Autocalibration:
   * Two views: find what works best between Hartley, Sturm and Pollefeys (linear to find a 2d solution space + quadratic to fix the ambiguity).
   * ~~N-views: fix implementation of Pollefeys linear method~~
 * Two view reconstruction gui:
   * ~~Set up a basic application enabling to open 2 images~~
   * ~~Compute surf on each image~~
   * ~~Display surf detections~~
   * ~~Find candidate matches using kdtree~~
   * ~~Compute robust matches and fundamental matrix~~
   * ~~Compute cameras' internal parameters~~
   * ~~Compute metric reconstruction~~
   * ~~Visualize it~~
   * ~~Bundle adjust the metric reconstruction~~
   * Try Sturm04 method for estimating a common focal length
   * Add the images to the camera background image in blender
 * Simple gui for KLT tracking
 * Check if doxygen's output looks ok
 * Implement matrix fliping functions and use them in K_From_AbsoluteConic
