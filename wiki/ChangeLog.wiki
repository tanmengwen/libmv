= Libmv 0.02 =
Released on *February 14, 2009*.

    * Added a dense reconstruction via plane sweep algorithm.

= Libmv 0.01 =
Released on *February 12, 2009*.

First release of libmv. Primary goal is to get something released that people can play with, even if it is extremely basic.

    * Contains a single executable for reconstructing from 2 uncalibrated images.
    * The output is a blender script, containing two cameras at the appropriate position, and the cloud of reconstructed points.
    * Builds on Linux, Windows, Mac.

Internally:

    * Has basic USURF implementation.
    * Has basic non-sparse bundle adjustment.
