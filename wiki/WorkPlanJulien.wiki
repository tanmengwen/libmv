#summary What Julien is been working on in libmv.

= General =
== Reconstruction ==
  * Implement a function that selects the best image couple in order to estimate the motion (using a criteria based on the homography and number of matches) 
  * then apply a graph traversal method
  * Implement a retriangulation function
=== Calibrated ===
  * ~~Robust euclidean resection (3 points or EPnP algorithm)~~
  * Rename the function EuclideanCameraResection to CalibratedCameraResection
  * Bundle and pose adjustment (we need a generic sparse nonlinear optimizer)
see also :
http://www.ros.org/browse/details.php?name=sba
=== Uncalibrated ===
  * Implement a UncalibratedCameraResection function
  * Implement a MetricRectification function (to upgrade an projective reconstruction into an euclidean one)

== Tracker ==
  * ~~remove the useless template TImage.~~ -We will define a pyramid image tracker class.-
  * replace the matcher pointer by an Enum.
  * find a way to make the tracker class to be the owner of the detector/describer classes, keeping in mind that the user should be able to choose its detector/describer (+parameters) : _use template/functors ?_
  * ~~find a solution to the Featureset delete issue:~~ _a structure/class with the matches and a vector/list of Features ?_
  * only match the new featureSet with one of the descriptor (and not all) of known features : a feature has approximately the same descriptor in every images
  * ~~make a robust Traker (epipolar filtering)~~ _see nvr, as a new  function/class ?_
  * make a robust Traker for planar scene (homography filtering) _see nvr, a PlanarTracker class ?_
  * add a parameter (?) to the feature detection in order to detect only the N best corners (proceed a feature filtering based on the features scores)
  * add a prediction step (based on a 2D or 3D movement model)
  * see the OpenTL architecture http://www.opentl.org/architecture.html

=== Image pyramid ===
  * extend the Tracker in order to handle images pyramid (intra/inter-level features matching)
  * how can we store the association of a feature with a pyramid level (and not an image)?

=== Masks ===
  * add a mask system so that we can associate a mask to an image. Every feature detectors should then only detect features in the visible zone (window).
  * add a mask system (?) in the matching process in order to handle predicted features (ellipsoid, rectangle, ...)

== Overview ==
  * Camera Tracking
    * 2D Tracking
      * Windowed tracker NxM px mask
      * Local tracking (only track in the N last views)
    * Robust pose estimation(resection)
      * Linear pose estimation (3 or 5 points) + RANSAC (detect & remove outliers)
      * Non-linear pose refinement 
    * Keyframe detection
      * Enough correspondences in the N last views, enough inliers, ...
  * Mapping (only for keyframes)
    * Triangulation (intersection)
      * Linear 3D points triangulation of inliers
    * Refinement
      * global/local Bundle Adjustment

== Overview ==

..a variant of SLAM.

  * FAST-10 detector / Patch 8x8px based descriptor
  * image pyramid (4 levels)
  * a camera motion model
  * 2D predicted features reprojection
  * Affine warp patch (predicted "descriptors")
  * coarse resection (reproject 50 best points)
  * no RANSAC but M-estimator (Tukey) with 10 iterations WLS
  * and various other stuffs
