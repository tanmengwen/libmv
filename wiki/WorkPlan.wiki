#summary The fastest pathway from the start of the rewrite to a working tracker.

= Introduction =

There is an almost infinite amount of work that _could_ be on libmv. To keep focused on producing something useful, here is a plan to get to something that is _useful_, though perhaps not feature-complete, in the shortest time possible.

In rough order of dependence:

= Work plan =

== Basic matrix and vector functionality ==

  * ~~Fixed size arrays. 0.5 day.~~
  * ~~Variable sized arrays. 1 day.~~
  * ~~Dot product, outer product. 1 hour, without BLAS. 1 day using BLAS (not necessary at first).~~
  * ~~SVD - Use LAPACK. Not trivial. 1 day.~~

_We are going to use FLENS_.

  * ~~Check current CVS into libmv third_party/~~
  * ~~Make super-simple wrapper for common operations inside libmv (i.e. typedefs for `DenseVector<FullStorage<double> >` as 'Vector', etc). ~~
  * ~~Polish FLENS's existing support for tiny vectors.~~

See MatrixLibrary for other details.

== Image class and loading ==

  * Simple image class built on a matrix. Supports images that own and don't own the underlying data. 1 day.
  * Load PNG images. 3 hours.
  * Load JPG images. 2 hours.

== Image processing and caching ==

  * Simple LRU cache for holding images. *DONE*.

== Correspondence Library ==
